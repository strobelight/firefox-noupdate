# firefox-noupdate

In case you have a firefox that is always kept up to date, and you get the dreaded, _"Sorry. We just need to do one small thing to keep going."_, which causes a restart of firefox, but you use _Private browsing_ mode, and so a restart would kill all your open windows, never to be restored, this script attempts to prevent that from happening.

Others more knowledgeable please let me know if the solution is incorrect.

This is based off a _kitfox-patch_ script found in [akkana's scripts](https://github.com/akkana/scripts.git) repo on github. I didn't do a fork since I didn't need them all. The original script is based off someone else's blog, so see the script for more information.

I made slight changes to the script, as well as provide a sed command to disable updates. I also named the script differently for its intended purpose. Sure, if you have other _patches_ you also like to do, rename as _kitfox-patch_ as found in the original repo.
